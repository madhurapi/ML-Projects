### Airlines:
The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure.
No null values. LR, CatBoost, RF performed.

### Chemical Segregation
To predict the chemical denoted by 0 and 1. Combination of different chemicals(f1, f2, f3)  used for predicting the presence of chemical.

### Fire_Acoustics
Throughout the flame extinguishing experiments, the data obtained from each measurement device was recorded and a dataset was created.
The dataset includes the features of fuel container size representing the flame size, fuel type, frequency, decibel, distance, airflow and flame extinction.
Accordingly, 6 input features and 1 output feature will be used in models. 
The status property (flame extinction or non-extinction states) can be predicted by using six features in the dataset. 
Status and fuel features are categorical, while other features are numerical.

### Pumpkin Seed Variety Prediction
Pumpkin seeds are frequently consumed as confection worldwide because of their adequate amount of protein, 
fat, carbohydrate, and mineral contents. This study was carried out on the two most important and 
quality types of pumpkin seeds, ‘‘Urgup_Sivrisi’’ and ‘‘Cercevelik’’, generally grown in Urgup and 
Karacaoren regions in Turkey. However, morphological measurements of 2500 pumpkin seeds of both varieties 
were made possible by using the gray and binary forms of threshold techniques.
